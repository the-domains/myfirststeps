BMC merged with Jaguar Cars in 1966 to form British Motor
Holdings (BMH). Donald Healey left BMH in 1968 when it merged into British
Leyland. Healey then joined Jensen Motors, which had been making bodies for the
"big Healeys" since their inception in 1952, and became their
chairman in 1972\. Austin-Healey cars were produced until 1972 when the 20-year
agreement between Healey and Austin came to an end.
